          <p>Jeep is a brand of American automobile and division of FCA US LLC (formerly Chrysler Group, LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Italian-American corporation Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.[3][4] Jeep has been a part of Chrysler since 1987, when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand, along with remaining assets, from its previous owner American Motors Corporation (AMC). Jeep's product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles â€“ both cross-overs and fully off-road worthy models, including one pickup truck. Previously, Jeep's range included other pick-ups, as well as small vans, and a few roadsters.</p>

          <p>The first-of-its-kind, premium AC lounge for bus travellers. They can now wait for their bus to arrive in the comfort of an air-conditioned lounge that is equipped with all modern amenities. If we see the travel trends, till now most bus travellers have always had to wait for their buses in uneasy conditions, like isolated roads or under the glaring Sun but with the launch of IntrCity SmartBus Lounge, they get the convenience they always needed.</p>

          <p>Elite i20 is the best car for me. It's very good in comfort, good build quality materials used inside & outside of car but need to compromise with mileage of petrol i20. But one thing sure once you enter inside of car & drive it, you feel premium car like Audi driving experience. Performance wise car takes times to get pick up in 2nd gear, It easily go 60 - 100 km without any extra efforts very smoothly. Need to say if you are looking for premium class with good comfort can go blindly with i20 but mileage wise slightly slow compare to any Maruti vehicles.</p>
